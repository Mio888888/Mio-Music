// Modified by Longbridge for gpui-fast.
//! Subtrees drawn again from what they drew on the last frame.
//!
//! Views and cached views are retained subtrees. Each one drawn in a
//! frame leaves a record there: where its hitboxes, dispatch nodes, listeners
//! and primitives went, what it read while it was built, the hovers it was
//! painted by and the layout nodes it holds. On the next frame, a subtree
//! whose record says nothing it depends on has changed is drawn again by
//! copying those stretches of the last frame instead of building, laying out,
//! prepainting and painting it.
//!
//! The records live in the frame rather than in element state because the
//! stretches they point to belong to one frame. A subtree drawn again from
//! last frame is not visited, so the records of subtrees nested in it would
//! otherwise keep pointing into the frame they were last visited in. Instead,
//! drawing a subtree again copies its record and the records nested in it,
//! shifted to where the copy landed, so that any of them can be drawn again
//! on its own later, when what is around it has to be built.
