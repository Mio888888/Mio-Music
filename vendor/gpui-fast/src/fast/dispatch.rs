// Modified by Longbridge for gpui-fast.
//! Copying a stretch of last frame's dispatch nodes into this frame's tree in
//! one pass.
//!
//! Upstream's [`DispatchTree::reuse_subtree`] copies a reused stretch node by
//! node: it pops the nodes the previous one left open until it reaches the
//! node's parent, pushes a new node, and pushes and pops the key contexts and
//! views along the way. The nodes of a stretch are last frame's in the same
//! order, so each one's new parent is known without any of that: a parent in
//! the stretch moved by as much as the stretch did, and a parent before it is
//! one of the nodes the copy was left open in, or else the node the copy hangs
//! off. [`copy_nodes`] writes the nodes that way and only then brings the
//! tree's stacks to where node-by-node copying would have left them.
